      "Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your SharePoint Framework project is a great way to automate the build and deployment process. This script will create either a GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline for your SharePoint Framework project. The script will ask you a few questions to configure the pipeline and then create the necessary files for you. When using 'application' login method which is recommended the script will also create a new certificate which is required for the app to authenticate and will create a new Entra app registration in a single go. Start your development with DevOps in place and don't leave it for the very end."
