## Remarks

When deleted, Microsoft 365 groups are moved to a temporary container and can be restored within 30 days. After that time, they are permanently deleted. This applies only to Microsoft 365 groups.

If the command finds multiple Microsoft Teams teams with the specified name, it will prompt you to disambiguate which team it should use, listing the discovered team IDs.

## Examples

m365 teams team remove --name "Team Name"
```

```sh
m365 teams team remove --id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --force
```
