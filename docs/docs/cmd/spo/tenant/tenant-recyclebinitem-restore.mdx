# spo tenant recyclebinitem restore

Restores the specified deleted Site Collection from Tenant Recycle Bin

## Usage

```sh
m365 spo tenant recyclebinitem restore [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-u, --siteUrl <siteUrl>`
: URL of the site to restore

`--wait`
: Wait for the site collection to be restored before completing the command
```

<Global />

## Remarks

Restoring deleted site collections is by default asynchronous and depending on the current state of Microsoft 365, might take up to few minutes. If you're building a script with steps that require the site to be fully restored, you should use the `--wait` flag. When using this flag, the `spo tenant recyclebinitem restore` command will keep running until it received confirmation from Microsoft 365 that the site has been fully restored.

:::info

To use this command you have to have permissions to access the tenant admin site.
