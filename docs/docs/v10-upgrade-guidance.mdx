### Updated `spo site appcatalog remove` options

We updated the [spo site appcatalog remove](./cmd/spo/site/site-appcatalog-remove.mdx) command. This command is a destructive operation that removes a site collection app catalog. Previously, it did not prompt for confirmation before executing this action, which could potentially lead to unintended data loss. To address this, we have added a confirmation prompt by default.

Because of this rework, we have added a new option.

**New options:**

Option | Description
--- | ---
`-f, --force` | Don't prompt for confirmation.

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts with the following:

- Add the option `--force` if you want to bypass the confirmation prompt and proceed with the removal operation automatically.
