## Remarks

This commands helps you to verify if your environment meets all prerequisites for building solutions using a particular version of the SharePoint Framework.

The command starts by detecting the version of SharePoint Framework that you want to use. First, it looks at the current project. If you didn't run the command in the context of a SharePoint Framework project, the command will try to determine the SharePoint Framework version based on the SharePoint Framework Yeoman generator that you have installed either in the current directory or globally.

Based on the determined version of the SharePoint Framework, the command will look at other dependencies such as Node.js, npm, Yeoman, Gulp CLI and TypeScript to verify if their meet the requirements of that particular version of the SharePoint Framework.

If you miss any required tools or use a version that doesn't meet the SharePoint Framework requirements, the command will give you a list of recommendation how to address these issues.

Next to verifying the readiness of your environment to use a particular version of the SharePoint Framework, you can also check if the version of the SharePoint Framework that you use is compatible with the specific version of SharePoint. Supported versions are `sp2016`, `sp2019` and `spo`.
