| Old option | New option |
|---------------|---------------|
| --appId [appId] | -i, --id [id] |
| --appName [appName] | -n, --displayName [displayName] |

[entra enterpriseapp get](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/enterpriseapp/enterpriseapp-get)

| Old option | New option |
|---------------|---------------|
| -i, --appId [appId] | -i, --id [id] |
| -n, --appDisplayName [appDisplayName] | -n, --displayName [displayName] |
| --appObjectId [appObjectId] | --objectId [objectId] |

[entra enterpriseapp list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/enterpriseapp/enterpriseapp-list)

| Old option | New option |
|---------------|---------------|
| --displayName [displayName] | -n, --displayName [displayName] |

#### What action do I need to take?

Please, check the documentation of the [entra enterpriseapp add](./cmd/entra/enterpriseapp/enterpriseapp-add), [entra enterpriseapp get](./cmd/entra/enterpriseapp/enterpriseapp-get), and [entra enterpriseapp list](./cmd/entra/enterpriseapp/enterpriseapp-list) commands to see the updated options and adjust your scripts accordingly.

## SharePoint

### Updated `spo site appcatalog remove` options

We updated the [spo site appcatalog remove](./cmd/spo/site/site-appcatalog-remove.mdx) command. This command is a destructive operation that removes a site collection app catalog. Previously, it did not prompt for confirmation before executing this action, which could potentially lead to unintended data loss. To address this, we have added a confirmation prompt by default.

Because of this rework, we have added a new option.

**New options:**

Option | Description
--- | ---
`-f, --force` | Don't prompt for confirmation.

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts with the following:

- Add the option `--force` if you want to bypass the confirmation prompt and proceed with the removal operation automatically.

### Removed the deprecated `wait` option and output from the `spo tenant recyclebinitem restore` command

For this new major version, we've removed the deprecated `wait` option from the `spo tenant recyclebinitem restore` command. The command now won't return a response on success.

#### What action do I need to take?

- Please, check the documentation of the [spo tenant recyclebinitem restore](./cmd/spo/tenant/tenant-recyclebinitem-restore.mdx) command to see the updated output and adjust your scripts accordingly.
- In the `spo tenant recyclebinitem restore` command, remove deprecated `wait` option from your scripts.

### Removed the deprecated `wait` option and output from the `spo site remove` command

For this new major version, we've removed the deprecated `wait` option from the `spo site remove` command.

#### What action do I need to take?

In the [spo site remove](./cmd/spo/site/site-remove.mdx) command, remove deprecated `wait` option from your scripts.

### Removes duplicate property from 'spo list list' command.

In the [spo list list](./cmd/spo/list/list-list.mdx) we removed the `Url` from the command output as it was a duplicate of the `RootFolder/ServerRelativeUrl` property.

#### What action do I need to take?

Please update your scripts not to use the `Url` property from the command output.

### Updated command `spo file copy`

Because of some limitations of the current [spo file copy](./cmd/spo/file/file-copy.mdx) command, we have decided to move it to a new endpoint. This change is necessary to ensure the command's functionality and reliability. Because of the new endpoint, the command input and output have changed.

**Command options:**

Unfortunately, we had to drop the `--resetAuthorAndCreated` options as it's no longer supported by the new endpoint. In return, we were able to add two new options:
- `--ignoreVersionHistory`: Only copy the most recent version of the file and ignore the version history.
- `--skipWait`: Don't wait for the copy operation to complete.

**Command output:**

In the past versions of CLI for Microsoft 365, the command had no output. When using option `--nameConflictBehavior rename`, it's hard for the user to know what the actual name of the copied file is. With the new endpoint, the command now returns the file information about the destination file, providing you with all the info you need to execute other commands on this file.

#### What action do I need to take?

When using the [spo file copy](./cmd/spo/file/file-copy.mdx) command, please use the new command input. This means that you'll have to remove option `--resetAuthorAndCreated` from your scripts and automation tools.

### Removed `spo folder rename` alias

The `spo folder rename` command was removed and replaced by the [spo folder set](./cmd/spo/folder/folder-set.mdx) command.

#### What action do I need to take?

Please, update your scripts to use the `spo folder set` command instead of `spo folder rename`.

### Updated output of `spo applicationcustomizer get` command

In the previous version of CLI, the command output had a `Rights` property that was a stringified JSON object. In this release, this has been changed to a JSON object.

#### What action do I need to take?

Please, check the documentation of the [spo applicationcustomizer get](./cmd/spo/applicationcustomizer/applicationcustomizer-get.mdx) command to see the updated output and adjust your scripts accordingly.

## SharePoint Framework

### Removed overwrite option from `spfx project github workflow add` command

Overwriting the SPFx package should be the default behavior of the continuous delivery pipeline. The `overwrite` option was removed from the [spfx project github workflow add](./cmd/spfx/project/project-github-workflow-add.mdx) command.

#### What action do I need to take?

Please update your scripts not to use the `overwrite` option.

## Yammer (Viva Engage)

### Removal of deprecated Yammer aliases

We have removed all deprecated `Yammer` command aliases. These aliases were introduced in the previous version to prevent the introduction of breaking changes. Since Yammer has been renamed to Viva Engage a while ago, the following aliases were removed:
