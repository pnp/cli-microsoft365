## Remarks

On personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder.

Notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other `driveItem` instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to `drive` or `driveItem` instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

In Outlook, delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox.
That means, for example, you cannot use the delegated permission Calendars.Read to subscribe to events in another userâ€™s mailbox.

To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in shared or delegated folders:

- Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in a folder or mailbox of any user in the tenant.
- Do not use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do not support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders.

## Examples

Create a subscription

```sh
m365 graph subscription add --resource "me/mailFolders('Inbox')/messages" --changeType "updated" --notificationUrl "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/send/myNotifyClient" --expirationDateTime "2016-11-20T18:23:45.935Z" --clientState "secretClientState"

```

Create a subscription on multiple change types

```sh
m365 graph subscription add --resource groups --changeType updated,deleted --notificationUrl "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/send/myNotifyClient" --expirationDateTime "2016-11-20T18:23:45.935Z" --clientState "secretClientState"

```

Create a subscription using the maximum allowed expiration for Group resources

```sh
m365 graph subscription add --resource groups --changeType "updated" --notificationUrl "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/send/myNotifyClient"
```
