`--objectId [objectId]`
: Application objectId of the App Registration for which the configured scopes (app roles) should be deleted

`--displayName [displayName]`
: Application name of the App Registration for which the configured scopes (app roles) should be deleted

`-r, --resource <resource>`
: Service principal name, appId or objectId that has the scopes (roles) ex. `SharePoint`

`-s, --scope <scope>`
: Permissions known also as scopes and roles to be deleted from the application. If multiple permissions have to be deleted, they have to be comma separated ex. `Sites.Read.All`,`Sites.ReadWrite.All`

## Remarks

This command requires tenant administrator permissions.

Specify either the `appId`, `objectId` or `displayName` but not both. If you specify more than one option value, the command will fail with an error.

Autocomplete values for the `resource` option do not mean allowed values. The autocomplete will just suggest some known names, but that doesn't restrict you to use name of your own custom application or other application within your tenant.

This command can also be used to assign permissions to system- or user-assigned managed identity.
