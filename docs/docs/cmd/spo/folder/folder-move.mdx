# spo folder move

Moves a folder to another location

## Usage

```sh
m365 spo folder move [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-u, --webUrl <webUrl>`
: The URL of the site where the folder is located.

`-s, --sourceUrl [sourceUrl]`
: The server-, site-relative or absolute decoded URL of the folder to move. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-i, --sourceId [sourceId]`
: The ID of the folder to move. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-t, --targetUrl <targetUrl>`
: Server-relative or absolute decoded URL where to move the folder.

`--newName [newName]`
: The new name of the destination folder.

`--nameConflictBehavior [nameConflictBehavior]`
: Behavior when a file or folder with the same name is already present at the destination. Allowed values: `fail`, `rename`. Defaults to `fail`.

`--retainEditorAndModified`
: Use this option to retain the editor and modified date. When not specified, these values are reset.

`--bypassSharedLock`
: This indicates whether a folder with a share lock can still be moved. Use this option to move a folder that is locked.
```

## Remarks

All folder versions are retained while moving a folder.

When you specify a value for `nameConflictBehavior`, consider the following:

- `fail` will throw an error when the destination folder already exists.
- `rename` will add a suffix (e.g. folder1) when the destination folder already exists.

## Examples

Move a folder to a document library in another site collection by server-relative URL.

```sh
m365 spo folder move --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --sourceUrl "/sites/project-x/Shared Documents/Reports" --targetUrl "/sites/project-y/Shared Documents/Reports January"
```

Move a folder to another location using site-relative URLs and rename it.

```sh
m365 spo folder move --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --sourceUrl "/Shared Documents/Reports" --targetUrl "/sites/project-y/Shared Documents" --newName "Reports January"
```

Move a folder to another location and use a new name on conflict.

```sh
m365 spo folder move --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --sourceUrl "/sites/project-x/Shared Documents/Reports" --targetUrl "/sites/project-y/Shared Documents/Project files" --nameConflictBehavior rename
