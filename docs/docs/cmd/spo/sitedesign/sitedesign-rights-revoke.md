# spo sitedesign rights revoke

Revokes access from a site design for one or more principals

## Usage

```sh
m365 spo sitedesign rights revoke [options]
```

## Options

`-i, --siteDesignId <siteDesignId>`
: The ID of the site design to revoke rights from

`-p, --principals <principals>`

## Remarks

If the specified id doesn't refer to an existing site design, you will get a `File not found` error.

If all principals have rights revoked on the site design, the site design becomes viewable to everyone.

If you try to revoke access for a user that doesn't have access granted to the specified site design you will get a `The specified user or domain group was not found error`.

## Examples

Revoke access to the site design with ID _2c1ba4c4-cd9b-4417-832f-92a34bc34b2a_ from user with alias _PattiF_. Will prompt for confirmation before revoking the access

```sh
m365 spo sitedesign rights revoke --siteDesignId 2c1ba4c4-cd9b-4417-832f-92a34bc34b2a --principals PattiF
```
