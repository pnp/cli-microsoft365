# planner roster member remove

## Usage

```

## Options

## Remarks

:::caution

This command is based on an API that is currently in preview and is subject to change once the API reached general availability.

:::

:::caution

The Planner Roster will be deleted when it doesn't have any users remaining in the membership list because the last user removed themselves. Roster, its plan and all contained tasks will be deleted within 30 days of this operation. We will show an extra prompt when this happens. This prompt is also suppressed when specifying `--confirm`.
