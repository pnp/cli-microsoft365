## Remarks

### Attachments

When using the `attachment` option, note that the total size of all attachment files cannot exceed 3 MB.

### If you are connected using app only authentication

- Always specify a user id or upn in the `--sender` option. The email will be sent as if it came from the specified user, and can optionally be saved in the sent folder of that user account.
- You can optionally also specify the `--mailbox` option to send mail on behalf of a shared mailbox, group or distribution list. The account used in the `--sender` option, needs to have 'Send on behalf of' permissions on the mailbox in question.

!!! important
    You need `Mail.Send` application permissions on the Microsoft Graph to be able to send mails using an application identity. 

### If you are connected with a regular user account

- Specify the `--mailbox` option if you want to send an email on behalf of another mailbox. This can be a shared mailbox, group or distribution list. It will be visible in the email that the email was sent by you. You need to be assigned `Send on behalf of` permissions on the mailbox in question.  
- You can specify the `--sender` option if you want to send an email as if you were the other user.
The sent email can optionally be saved in the sent folder of that user account. You'll need `Read and manage (Full Access)` permissions on the mailbox of the other user. You can combine the `--sender` and `--mailbox` options to let the other user send a mail on behalf of the specified mailbox.

!!! important
    You need at least `Mail.Send` delegated permissions on the Microsoft Graph to be able to send emails. When specifying another user as sender, you'll need `Mail.Send.Shared` permissions.
