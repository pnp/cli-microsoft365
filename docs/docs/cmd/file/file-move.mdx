# file move

Moves a file to another location using the Microsoft Graph

## Usage

```sh
m365 file move [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-u, --webUrl <webUrl>`
: The URL of the site where the file is located.

`-s, --sourceUrl <sourceUrl>`
: Server-relative or absolute URL of the file.

`-t, --targetUrl <targetUrl>`
: Server-relative or absolute URL of the location.

`--newName [newName]`

```

<Global />

## Remarks

- If the source and target locations are within the same document library or drive, the command will utilize the Move DriveItem API, preserving the version history of the file.
- If the source and target locations are in different document libraries or drives, the command will use a copy-and-delete combination to move the file. Please note that in this case, version history will not be retained.
