`-b, --branchName [branchName]`

## Remarks

The `spfx project github workflow add` will create a workflow .yml file in the `.github/workflows` directory in your project. If such directory does not exist the command will automatically create it.

For the `application` login method the command does not register a Microsoft Entra application nor create the required certificate. In order for you to proceed you will need to first obtain (create) a self-signed certificate and register a new Microsoft Entra application with certificate authentication. After that in GitHub repo settings, you will need to create the following secrets:

- `APP_ID` - client id of the registered Microsoft Entra application
- `CERTIFICATE_ENCODED` - application's encoded certificate
- `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` - certificate password. This applies only if the certificate is encoded which is the recommended approach

This use case is perfect in a production context as it does not create any dependencies on an account

For the `user` login method you will need to create the following secrets in GitHub repo settings:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - username
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - password

This method is perfect to test your workflow, in a dev context, for personal usage. It will not work for accounts with MFA.

The workflow will overwrite the existing .sppkg if it is already deployed in the app catalog. Overwriting your sppkg file on every deployment is required to make continuous delivery of the latest version of your app which is the aim of the continuous delivery pipeline.
