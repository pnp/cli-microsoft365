## Remarks

Running this command from the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe) or PowerShell for Windows OS XP, 7, 8, 8.1 without bash installed might require additional formatting for clientSideComponentProperties option that has JSON value because the command shell treats quotes differently. For example, this is how Application Customizer can be updated from the Windows cmd.exe:

```sh
m365 spo tenant applicationcustomizer set --id 3 --clientSideComponentProperties '{\"someProperty\":\"Some value\"}'
```

Note, how the clientSideComponentProperties option (--clientSideComponentProperties) has escaped double quotes `'{\"someProperty\":\"Some value\"}'` compared to execution from bash `'{"someProperty": "Some value"}'`.

:::caution Escaping JSON in PowerShell
    
When using the `--clientSideComponentProperties` option it's possible to enter a JSON string. In PowerShell 5 to 7.2 [specific escaping rules](./../../../user-guide/using-cli.mdx#escaping-double-quotes-in-powershell) apply due to an issue. Remember that you can also use [file tokens](./../../../user-guide/using-cli.mdx#passing-complex-content-into-cli-options) instead.
