## Remarks

The `m365 setup` command is a wizard that helps you configure the CLI for Microsoft 365 for your needs. It will ask you a series of questions and based on your answers, it will configure the CLI for Microsoft 365 for you.

The command will ask you the following questions:

- _CLI for Microsoft 365 requires a Microsoft Entra app. Do you want to create a new app registration or use an existing one?_

  You can choose between using an existing Entra app or creating a new one. If you choose to create a new app, the CLI will ask you to choose between a minimal and a full set of permissions. It then signs in as Azure CLI to your tenant, creates a new app registration, and stores its information in the CLI configuration.

- _How do you plan to use the CLI?_

  You can choose between **interactive** and **scripting** use. In interactive mode, the CLI for Microsoft 365 will prompt you for additional information when needed, automatically open links browser, automatically show help on errors. In **scripting** mode, the CLI will not use interactivity to prevent blocking your scripts.

- _Are you going to use the CLI in PowerShell?_ (asked only when you chose to configure CLI for scripting)

  To simplify using CLI in PowerShell, you can configure the CLI to output errors to stdout, instead of the default stderr which is tedious to handle in PowerShell.

- _How experienced are you in using the CLI?_

  You can choose between **beginner** and **proficient**. If you're just starting working with the CLI, it will show you full help information. For more experienced users, it will only show information about commands' options. No matter how you configure this setting, you can always invoke full help by using `--help full`.

After you answer these questions, the command will build a preset and ask you to confirm using it to configure the CLI.

If you want to configure the CLI on a non-interactive system, or want to configure CLI without answering the questions, you can use the `--interactive` or `--scripting` options. When using these options, CLI will apply the correct presets. Additionally, it will detect if it's used in PowerShell and configure CLI accordingly.

The `m365 setup` command uses the following presets:

- interactive use:
  - autoOpenLinksInBrowser: true,
  - copyDeviceCodeToClipboard: true,
  - output: 'text',
  - printErrorsAsPlainText: true,
  - prompt: true,
  - showHelpOnFailure: true,
- scripting use:
  - autoOpenLinksInBrowser: false,
  - copyDeviceCodeToClipboard: false,
  - output: 'json',
  - printErrorsAsPlainText: false,
  - prompt: false,
  - showHelpOnFailure: false,
- use in PowerShell:
  - errorOutput: 'stdout'
- beginner:
  - helpMode: 'full'
- proficient:
  - helpMode: 'options'
