`-b, --branchName [branchName]`
: Specify the branch name which should trigger the workflow on push. If none is specified a default will be used which is 'main'

`-m, --manuallyTrigger`

`-s, --scope [scope]`
: Scope of the app catalog: `tenant`, `sitecollection`. Default is `tenant`

`-u, --siteUrl [siteUrl]`
: The URL of the site collection where the solution package will be added. Required if scope is set to `sitecollection`

## Remarks

The `spfx project github workflow add` will create a workflow .yml file in the `.github/workflows` directory in your project. If such directory does not exist the command will automatically create it.

For the `application` login method the command does not register Microsoft Entra nor create the required certificate. In order for you to proceed you will need to first obtain (create) a self-signed certificate and register a new Microsoft Entra with certificate authentication. After that in GitHub repo settings, you will need to create the following secrets:

- `APP_ID` - client id of the registered Microsoft Entra
- `CERTIFICATE_ENCODED` - application's encoded certificate
- `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` - certificate password. This applies only if the certificate is encoded which is the recommended approach

This use case is perfect in a production context as it does not create any dependencies on an account

For the `user` login method you will need to create the following secrets in GitHub repo settings:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - username
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - password

This method is perfect to test your workflow, in a dev context, for personal usage. It will not work for accounts with MFA.
