# v7 Upgrade Guidance

The v7 of CLI for Microsoft 365 introduces several breaking changes. To help you upgrade to the latest version of CLI for Microsoft 365, we've listed those changes along with any actions you may need to take.

## Removed option `schemaXml` for `spo list` commands

In version 7 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, we have removed the option `schemaXml` for the `spo list add` and `spo list set` commands. This option was used to specify the list schema XML when creating a list. We have removed this option as it is no longer supported by Microsoft 365.

### What action do I need to take?

Remove the references to the option `schemaXml` from your scripts. Verify that your scripts work as intended.

## Removed `deleted` option from the `aad user list` command

In version 6 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, you can get the deleted users using the command `aad user list` by giving an option `deleted`. Now we have removed that option from the command. For getting the deleted users, you can use the command [aad user recyclebinitem list ](./cmd/aad/user/user-recyclebinitem-list.mdx)

### What action do I need to take?

Remove the references to the `deleted` option in your scripts. Verify that your scripts are using the command [aad user recyclebinitem list ](./cmd/aad/user/user-recyclebinitem-list.mdx) instead.

## Updated `spo tenant commandset set` command with more options

In version 6 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, for setting the list commandset, you can only do it using `id` option. Now we have expanded the feature so that you can also update existing commandset using either of `id` or `title` or `clientSideComponentId`.

### What action do I need to take?

Since the option `id` was mandatory in V6 and if your scripts are dependent on the default mandatory error output which the command would return, you may have to update your scripts accordingly.

## Enhanced `flow run list` and `flow environment list` output

In version 7 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, we have made an enhancement for the data returned by the `flow run list` and `flow environment list` commands. Currently, when no items were found, we would only log an output when `--verbose` was specified. This made this command very unpredictable to use in scripts. This has now been changed so an empty array will be logged when no items were found. Also, when specifying `--output json`, we would have duplicate properties in the result. These properties have been removed.

### What action do I need to take?

Make sure that your scripts will now expect an empty array instead of nothing when no results are found and if using `--output json`, make sure that the removed properties are remapped to the correct properties.

## Enhanced `flow environment get` output

In version 7 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, we have made an enhancement for the data returned by the `flow environment get` command. Currently, when specifying `--output json`, we would have duplicate properties on the results object. Those have been removed from the result.

### What action do I need to take?

Make sure that the removed properties are remapped to the correct properties when using `--output json`.

## Aligned options with naming convention

In version 7 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, we have made updates to the options for certain commands, aligning with our naming convention. This includes renaming options to ensure consistency and improve the CLI experience. For example, the option `--environment` for the command `m365 pa app consent set` has been changed to `--environmentName`. These changes aim to make it easier for you to use the CLI.

We've updated the following commands and options:
