## Remarks

While the command uses the term *'remove'*, like its equivalent PowerShell cmdlet, it does not remove the special library **Apps for SharePoint** from the site collection. Instead, it disables the site collection app catalog in that site. Packages deployed to the app catalog are not available within the site collection.

:::info

To use this command you have to have permissions to access the tenant admin site.
