> ### One PR = One Commit
>
> We prefer to review pull requests that contain a single commit as this makes it easier to keep the history clear for everyone and track what's changed.
>
> If you are new to git, we'll squash your commits for you when merging your changes.
>
> To squash your commits, use the interactive rebase method, `git rebase -i HEAD~<commits>`, squashing the commits into a single commit and changing your commit message to be the same as your pull request title.
