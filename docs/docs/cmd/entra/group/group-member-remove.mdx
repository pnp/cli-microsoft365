## Remarks

:::tip

When you use the `suppressNotFound` option, the command will not return an error if a user is not found as either an owner or a member of the group.
This feature proves useful when you need to remove a user from a group, but you are uncertain whether the user holds the role of a member or an owner within that group.
Without using this option, you would need to manually verify the user's role in the group before proceeding with removal.
