## Remarks

:::caution

This command is based on an API that is currently in preview and is subject to change once the API reached general availability.

:::

By default, the command will try to disable Power Automate flows you own. If you want to disable Power Automate flows owned by another user, use the `asAdmin` flag.

If the environment with the name you specified doesn't exist, you will get the `Access to the environment 'xyz' is denied.` error.

If the Power Automate flow with the name you specified doesn't exist, you will get the `The caller with object id 'abc' does not have permission for connection 'xyz' under Api 'shared_logicflows'.` error. If you try to disable a non-existing flow as admin, you will get the `Could not find flow 'xyz'.` error.
