<Global />

## Remarks

This command requires tenant administrator permissions.

Specify either the `appId`, `appObjectId` or `appDisplayName` but not multiple. If you specify more than one option value, the command will fail with an error.

Autocomplete values for the `resource` option do not mean allowed values. The autocomplete will just suggest some known names, but that doesn't restrict you to use the name of your own custom application or other application within your tenant.

This command can also be used to assign permissions to system or user-assigned managed identity.

## Examples

```
