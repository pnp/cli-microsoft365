## Usage

```sh
m365 spo file copy [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-u, --webUrl <webUrl>`
: The URL of the site where the file is located.

`-s, --sourceUrl [sourceUrl]`
: Site-relative, server-relative or absolute URL of the file. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-i, --sourceId [sourceId]`
: The Unique ID (GUID) of the file. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-t, --targetUrl <targetUrl>`
: Server-relative or absolute URL of the location.

`--newName [newName]`
: New name of the destination file.

`--nameConflictBehavior [nameConflictBehavior]`
: Behavior when a document with the same name is already present at the destination. Possible values: `fail`, `replace`, `rename`. Default is `fail`.

`--bypassSharedLock`
: This indicates whether a file with a share lock can still be copied. Use this option to copy a file that is locked.

`--resetAuthorAndCreated`

```

## Remarks

:::info

The required URLs `webUrl`, `sourceUrl` and `targetUrl` cannot be encoded. When you do so, you will get a `File Not Found` error.

:::

When you specify a value for `nameConflictBehavior`, consider the following:

- `fail` will throw an error when the destination file already exists.
- `replace` will replace the destination file if it already exists.
- `rename` will add a suffix (e.g. Document1.pdf) when the destination file already exists.
