## More information

Rosters are a new type of container for Microsoft Planner plans. This enables users to create a Planner plan without the need to create a new Microsoft 365 group (with a mailbox, SharePoint site, ...). Access to Roster-contained plans is controlled by the members on the Roster. A Planner Roster can contain only 1 plan.
