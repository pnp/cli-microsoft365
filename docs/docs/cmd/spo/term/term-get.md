When retrieving term by its ID, it's sufficient to specify just the ID. When retrieving it by its name however, you need to specify the parent term group and term set using either their names or IDs.

## Examples

```sh
m365 spo term get --id 0e8f395e-ff58-4d45-9ff7-e331ab728beb
```

Get information about a taxonomy term using its name, retrieving the parent term group and term set using their names

```sh
m365 spo term get --name IT --termGroupName People --termSetName Department
```
