# spo tenant recyclebinitem remove

Removes the specified deleted Site Collection from Tenant Recycle Bin

## Usage

```sh
m365 spo tenant recyclebinitem remove [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-u, --siteUrl <siteUrl>`
: URL of the site to remove

`--wait`
: Wait for the site collection to be removed before completing the command

`-f, --force`
: Don't prompt for confirming removing the deleted site collection
```

<Global />

## Remarks

Removing a site collection is by default asynchronous and depending on the current state of Microsoft 365, might take up to few minutes. If you're building a script with steps that require the site to be fully removed, you should use the `--wait` flag. When using this flag, the `m365 spo tenant recyclebinitem remove` command will keep running until it received confirmation from Microsoft 365 that the site has been fully removed.

:::info

To use this command you must be either **SharePoint Administrator** or **Global Administrator**.
