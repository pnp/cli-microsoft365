Have you been creating a lot of beautiful themes lately and testing them in your dev tenant, but donâ€™t want to keep them anymore? If yes, then this PowerShell script is for you.

=== "PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    $sparksjoy = "Cat Lovers United", "Multicolored theme"
    $themes = m365 spo theme list -o json | ConvertFrom-Json
    $themes = $themes | where {-not ($sparksjoy -contains $_.name)}
    $themes | Format-Table name
    if ($themes.Count -eq 0) { break }
    Read-Host -Prompt "Press Enter to start deleting (CTRL + C to exit)"
    $progress = 0
    $total = $themes.Count
    foreach ($theme in $themes)
    {
      $progress++
      write-host $progress / $total":" $theme.name
      m365 spo theme remove --name "$($theme.name)" --confirm
    }
    ```

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # requires jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

    sparksjoy=("Cat Lovers United" "Multicolored theme")
    themestoremove=()
    while read theme; do
      exists=false
      for keep in "${sparksjoy[@]}"; do
        if [ "$keep" == "$theme" ] ; then
          exists=true
          break
        fi
      done
      if [ "$exists" = false ]; then
        themestoremove+=("$theme")
      fi
    done < <(m365 spo theme list -o json | jq -r '.[].name')

    if [ ${#themestoremove[@]} = 0 ]; then
      exit 1
    fi

    printf '%s\n' "${themestoremove[@]}"
    echo "Press Enter to start deleting (CTRL + C to exit)"
    read foo

    for theme in "${themestoremove[@]}"; do
      echo "Deleting $theme..."
      m365 spo theme remove --name "$theme" --confirm
    done
    ```
