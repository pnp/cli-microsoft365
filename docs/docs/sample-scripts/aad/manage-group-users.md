Companies pursue to hasten profits growth or enter new marketplace through Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A). M&A typically fails during integration. This also applies to migrating users and data in Microsoft Teams and Groups. Partial acquisition can be pretty tricky. To help make the activity as charming as possible, I have created the following sample script to add/remove bulk users to/from Microsoft Teams team or Microsoft 365 group using CLI for Microsoft 365 commands.

Note: Refactor the code as per your requirement.

=== "PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    $taskItems = import-csv "sample-input-file.csv" â€“header mailNickname, userEmail, role, action
    $groups = m365 aad o365group list -o json | ConvertFrom-Json

    ForEach ($taskItem in $taskItems) {

        $mailNickname = $($taskItem.mailNickname)
        $userEmail = $($taskItem.userEmail)
        $role = $($taskItem.role)
        $action = $($taskItem.action)

        $group = $groups | Where-Object { $_.mailNickname -eq "$mailNickname" }
        $user = m365 aad user get --userName $userEmail -o json | ConvertFrom-Json

        Write-Host "Processing: User --> " $user.mail " Group --> " $group.mailNickname

        If ($action -eq "add") {

            If ($role -eq "owner") {
                m365 aad o365group user add --groupId $group.id --userName $user.mail --role Owner; 
                Write-Host $user.mail " added as owner in " $group.mailNickname
            }
            ElseIf ($role -eq "member") {
                m365 aad o365group user add --groupId $group.id --userName $user.mail
                Write-Host $user.mail " added as member in " $group.mailNickname
            }
            Else {
                Write-Host "Invalid user role '" $role "'"
            }
        }
        ElseIf ($action -eq "remove") {
            m365 aad o365group user remove --groupId $group.id --userName $user.mail --confirm
            Write-Host $user.mail " removed from " $group.mailNickname
        }
        Else {
            Write-Host "Invalid task action '" $action "'"
        }
    }
    ```

=== "Input CSV File Format"

    ```csv
    groupMailNickname1, user1@domainname.com, owner, add
    groupMailNickname2, user2@domainname.com, member, add
    groupMailNickname3, user3@domainname.com, , remove
    ```
