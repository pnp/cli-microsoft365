## Remarks

The `spo folder remove` command will remove folder only if it is empty. If the folder contains any files, deleting the folder will fail.

## Examples

Remove a folder with a specific site-relative URL

```sh
m365 spo folder remove --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --url '/Shared Documents/My Folder'
```

Remove a folder with a specific server relative URL to the site recycle bin

```sh
m365 spo folder remove --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --url '/sites/project-x/Shared Documents/My Folder' --recycle
```
