## Remarks

By default, the command will try to remove a Power App. As maker, you are able to delete the Power Apps you own. As administrator, you are also able to delete Power Apps from other users.

To remove a model-driven Power App you need administrator permissions.

If the Power App with the name you specified doesn't exist, you will get the `Error: App 'abc' does not exist` error.
