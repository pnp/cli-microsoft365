## Remarks

:::info
The admin role that's required to deny permissions depends on the API. To approve permissions to any of the third-party APIs registered in the tenant, the application administrator role is sufficient. To approve permissions for Microsoft Graph or any other Microsoft API, the Global Administrator role is required.
:::

The permission request you want to approve is denoted using its `ID`. You can retrieve it using the [spo serviceprincipal permissionrequest list](./serviceprincipal-permissionrequest-list.mdx) command.
