```sh
m365 spo folder copy [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-u, --webUrl <webUrl>`
: The URL of the site where the folder is located.

`-s, --sourceUrl [sourceUrl]`
: The server-, site-relative or absolute decoded URL of the folder to copy. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-i, --sourceId [sourceId]`
: The UniqueId (GUID) of the folder. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-t, --targetUrl <targetUrl>`
: Server-relative or absolute decoded URL where to copy the folder.

`--newName [newName]`
: New name of the destination folder.

`--nameConflictBehavior [nameConflictBehavior]`
: Behavior when a file or folder with the same name is already present at the destination. Possible values: `fail`, `rename`. The default is `fail`.

`--resetAuthorAndCreated`
: Use this option to clear the author and created date. When not specified, the values from the source folder are used.

`--bypassSharedLock`
: This indicates whether a folder with a shared lock can still be moved. Use this option to copy a folder that is locked.
```

## Remarks

When you copy a folder with documents that have version history, only the latest document version is copied.

When you specify a value for `nameConflictBehavior`, consider the following:

- `fail` will throw an error when the destination folder already exists.
- `rename` will add a suffix (e.g. Folder1) when the destination folder already exists.
