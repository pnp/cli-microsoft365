# v6 Upgrade Guidance

The v6 of CLI for Microsoft 365 introduces several breaking changes. To help you upgrade to the latest version of CLI for Microsoft 365, we've listed those changes along with any actions you may need to take.

## Consolidated SharePoint Online site commands

In CLI for Microsoft 365 we had several commands that were originally targeted at classic SharePoint sites. All functionality in these commands has been merged with the regular SharePoint site commands and deprecated as a result. They have therefore been removed in v6. The commands that were removed are:

Command | Merged with
--|--
`spo site classic add` | [spo site add](./cmd/spo/site/site-add.md)
`spo site classic list` | [spo site list](./cmd/spo/site/site-list.md)
`spo site classic set` | [spo site set](./cmd/spo/site/site-set.md)

To fix a resulting issue with the `spo site list` command, the default value of the `type` option of that command has been removed.

### What action do I need to take?

Replace references to `spo site classic *` commands, with the respective `spo site *` command. The options have not changed and the output of the commands has not changed as well. After updating the references test your scripts as there might be slight differences in how the commands behave.

## Removed the `executeWithLimitedPermission` option in the `spo list list` command

In version 5 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, the `spo list list` command could only be executed with site owner permissions. To update this without introducing a breaking change, we temporarily added the `--executeWithLimitedPermission` option to be able to execute it as a site visitor or member as well. In v6 we removed this option while changing the command in such a way that you do not need to be a site owner anymore.

### What action do I need to take?

Remove the references to the `executeWithLimitedPermission` option in your scripts. Verify that your scripts work as intended with the new data structure returned by the `spo list list` command.

## Removed deprecated aliases

We removed several aliases to align commands with our naming convention. The following aliases were removed:

Alias | Command | Reason
--|--|--
`aad app delete` | [aad app remove](./cmd/aad/app/app-remove.md) | Removed to align with the naming convention.
`aad app role delete` | [aad app role remove](./cmd/aad/app/app-role-remove.md) | Removed to align with the naming convention.
`aad o365group restore` | [aad o365group recyclebinitem restore](./cmd/aad/o365group/o365group-recyclebinitem-restore.md) | Renamed to better match intention and naming convention.
`outlook sendmail` | [outlook mail send](./cmd/outlook/mail/mail-send.md) | Renamed to better match intention and naming convention.
`planner plan details get` | [planner plan get](./cmd/planner/plan/plan-get.md) | Functionality merged in a single get-command.
`planner task details get` | [planner task get](./cmd/planner/task/task-get.md) | Functionality merged in a single get-command.
`teams conversationmember add` | [teams channel member add](./cmd/teams/channel/channel-member-add.md) | Renamed to better match intention and naming convention.
`teams conversationmember list` | [teams channel member list](./cmd/teams/channel/channel-member-list.md) | Renamed to better match intention and naming convention.
`teams conversationmember remove` | [teams channel member remove](./cmd/teams/channel/channel-member-remove.md) | Renamed to better match intention and naming convention.

### What action do I need to take?

Replace any of the aliases mentioned above with the corresponding command name. The functionality of the command hasn't changed.

## In `planner` commands, removed the deprecated `planName` option

In several planner commands we renamed the `planName` option to `planTitle` to align with the underlying API. Along with introducing the `planTitle` option, we deprecated the old `planName` option. In v6 of the CLI we removed the `planName` option. The following list of commands is affected by this change:

- [planner bucket add](./cmd/planner/bucket/bucket-add.md)
- [planner bucket get](./cmd/planner/bucket/bucket-get.md)
- [planner bucket list](./cmd/planner/bucket/bucket-list.md)
- [planner bucket remove](./cmd/planner/bucket/bucket-remove.md)
- [planner bucket set](./cmd/planner/bucket/bucket-set.md)
- [planner task add](./cmd/planner/task/task-add.md)
- [planner task get](./cmd/planner/task/task-get.md)
- [planner task list](./cmd/planner/task/task-list.md)
- [planner task set](./cmd/planner/task/task-set.md)

### What action do I need to take?

Replace the reference to the `--planName` option with `--planTitle`.

## Removed the deprecated `autoOpenBrowserOnLogin` configuration key

The CLI for Microsoft 365 contains commands that return a link that the user should copy and open in the browser. At first, this was only available in the `login` command. We introduced the `autoOpenBrowserOnLogin` configuration key was introduced to have the CLI automatically open the browser, so that you don't have to copy/paste the URL manually. As we introduced this functionality to other commands, we renamed this configuration key to `autoOpenLinksInBrowser`. In v6 of the CLI, we removed the deprecated `autoOpenBrowserOnLogin` key.

### What action do I need to take?

If you have configured the `autoOpenBrowserOnLogin` key, you'll now need to configure the `autoOpenLinksInBrowser` key to keep the same behavior. You can do this by running the following script:

```sh
m365 cli config set --key autoOpenLinksInBrowser --value true
```

## Aligned options with naming convention

As we've been adding more commands to the CLI, we noticed that several commands were using inconsistent options names. Our naming convention states that options that refer to the last noun in the command, don't need that noun as a prefix. for example: the option `--webUrl` for `m365 spo web list` has been renamed to `--url` as the last noun is `web`. In version 6 of the CLI for Microsoft 365, we updated all these options to be consistent and make it easier for you to use the CLI.

We've updated the following commands and options:

Command|Old option|New option
--|--|--
[aad approleassignment add](./cmd/aad/approleassignment/approleassignment-add.md)|`objectId`|`appObjectId`
[aad approleassignment add](./cmd/aad/approleassignment/approleassignment-add.md)|`displayName`|`appDisplayName`

### What action do I need to take?

If you use any of the commands listed above, ensure that you use the new option names.
