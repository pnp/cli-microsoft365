# Ensure the Site Assets Library is created

Author: [Phillip Allan-Harding](https://github.com/phillipharding/)

There are occasions when creating a new modern SharePoint site using the CLI/REST API that the Site Assets library isn't created, use this script to ensure that the Site Assets library is created.

Reference: ['ensure' commands #1427](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/discussions/1427)

- gets the collection of lists at the site url supplied
- if a list with the title "Site Assets" isn't found
  - gets an access token for the tenant's SharePoint resource
  - calls the _api/web/Lists/EnsureSiteAssetsLibrary REST endpoint to create the Site Assets library
- returns the existing or created SPList as a JSON object

=== "PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    function EnsureSiteAssetsLibrary {
      param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)][string]$siteUrl
      )

      <#
        send a HTTP POST request to:
        https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<sitename>/_api/web/Lists/EnsureSiteAssetsLibrary/
        which returns an SPList
      #>
      Write-Host "-> Ensure Site Assets library: $siteUrl"
      $list = m365 spo list get --webUrl $siteUrl --title "Site Assets" | ConvertFrom-Json
      
      if ($null -eq $list) {
        Write-Host "...Creating Site Assets library"

        try {
          $resource = ($siteUrl -split "/")[2]
          $accessToken = m365 util accesstoken get --resource "https://$resource" --output text
        }
        catch {
          throw "!! Unable to get AccessToken for EnsureSiteAssetsLibrary at '$siteUrl'`nERROR: $_"
        }
        try {
          $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $accessToken"; "Accept" = "application/json;odata=nometadata" }
          $endpoint = "$siteUrl/_api/web/Lists/EnsureSiteAssetsLibrary/"
          $response = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $endpoint -Headers $headers -Method POST)
          $list = $response

          Write-Host "...Created: $($list.Id)"
        }
        catch {
          throw "!! Unable to EnsureSiteAssetsLibrary at '$siteUrl'`nERROR: $_"
        }
      } else {
        Write-Host "...Already exists: $($list.Id)"
      }

      $list
    }
    ```
