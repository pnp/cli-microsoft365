# v11 Upgrade Guidance

The v11 release of CLI for Microsoft 365 introduces several breaking changes. To assist you in upgrading to the latest version, we've outlined the changes and the actions you may need to take.

## SharePoint

### `spo homesite set` no longer adds new home sites

The [spo homesite set](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-set.mdx) command has been updated to only modify existing home sites. It will no longer add a new site as home site if you don't have any configured yet.

#### What action do I need to take?

- **For adding new home sites**: Use the new [spo homesite add](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-add.mdx) command instead
- **For updating existing home sites**: Continue using [spo homesite set](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-set.mdx) as before with required option `siteUrl`.

### `spo list view add` default paged option changed

The [spo list view add](./cmd/spo/list/list-view-add.mdx) command has been updated to change the default value of the `paged` option from `false` to `true`. This change reflects the common usage pattern where most views allow paging and fetch new items while scrolling down.

#### What action do I need to take?

- **If you want paged views (most common)**: No action required as this is now the default behavior.
- **If you want static views**: Explicitly specify `--paged false` when creating views that should not fetch new items while scrolling.

### Updated `homesite` commands and options

In the beginning when SharePoint home sites were introduced, you could only setup one single home site per tenant.
Nowadays, you can have multiple home sites in your tenant.
To reflect this change, we had to update our `spo homesite` commands to always require a URL to identify the home site to work with.

For the following commands, the `url` option is now required.

- [spo homesite get](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-get.mdx)
- [spo homesite remove](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-remove.mdx)

Additionally, the `spo homesite remove` command will not return a command output anymore. Since the command output was more informative in the past, we decided to just drop it.

Due to a change in the underlying API, the command output of `spo homesite get` has also been changed. Check the documentation for the latest output format.

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts to use the required `url` option in `spo homesite get` and `spo homesite remove` commands.
Additionally, update your scripts to handle the changed output of the `spo homesite get` command and the lack of output of the `spo homesite remove` command.

### `spo serviceprincipal grant list` command output updated

In order to align our commands with the latest updates done by Microsoft we had to update the API endpoint used by the [spo serviceprincipal grant list](./cmd/spo/serviceprincipal/serviceprincipal-grant-list.mdx) command. As a result, the output of this command has changed.

#### What action do I need to take?

- **If you parse the output of this command**: Update your scripts to handle the new output format. 

## SharePoint Framework

### Updated `spfx project upgrade` commands default behavior

The [spfx project upgrade](./cmd/spfx/project/project-upgrade.mdx) command has been updated to use PowerShell as the default shell instead of bash. This change reflects the current usage patterns where PowerShell is more commonly used than bash. 

#### What action do I need to take?

- **If you prefer bash**: Explicitly specify the `--shell` option with `bash` value when running the command
- **If you use PowerShell**: No action required as this is now the default behavior

## Teams

### Ensure list output for `teams report` commands

We noticed that some of the `list` commands were not returning an array, but an object with a `value` property. We've updated those commands to return an array of items.

The commands impacted by this change are:

- [teams report directroutingcalls](./cmd/teams/report/report-directroutingcalls.mdx)
- [teams report pstncalls](./cmd/teams/report/report-pstncalls.mdx)

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts to expect an array of items.


## General

### Changed the way to retrieve default environments

We've changed how Power Platform commands retrieve default environments for consistency across our commands. Previously, some commands would return the default environment when you didn't specify any options. Now, you need to explicitly specify the `--default` option to get the default environment.

Affected commands:

- [pp environment get](./cmd/pp/environment/environment-get.mdx)
- [flow environment get](./cmd/flow/environment/environment-get.mdx)
- [pa environment get](./cmd/pa/environment/environment-get.mdx)

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts to include the `--default` option when you want to retrieve the default environment.

### Ensured output for `list` commands

We noticed that some of the `list` commands were not returning any output when no items were found. We've updated all `list` commands to return an empty array when no items are found.

The commands impacted by this change are:

- [spo customaction list](./cmd/spo/customaction/customaction-list.mdx)

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts to expect an empty array when no items are found.

### Removed aliasses

We've removed some aliasses to streamline the command set and avoid confusion. The following aliasses have been removed:

- `pp chatbot get` is now [pp copilot get](./cmd/pp/copilot/copilot-get.mdx)
- `pp chatbot list` is now [pp copilot list](./cmd/pp/copilot/copilot-list.mdx)
- `pp chatbot remove` is now [pp copilot remove](./cmd/pp/copilot/copilot-remove.mdx)
- `spo tenant homesite list` is now [spo homesite list](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-list.mdx)

#### What action do I need to take?

Update any `pp chatbot` and `spo tenant homesite` references in your scripts to `pp copilot` and `spo homesite` for compatibility.

### Removed commands

Some commands were removed because their API endpoint became deprecated or the product began an end-of-life phase.

Read the documentation for alternative commands to find out how to use them and what permissions are required.

Command | Alternative
--- | ---
`pp card clone` | None
`pp card get` | None
`pp card list` | None
`pp card remove` | None
`spo mail send` | [outlook mail send](./cmd/outlook/mail/mail-send.mdx)
`skype report activitycounts` | None
`skype report activityusercounts` | None
`skype report activityuserdetail` | None
`viva engage group list` | [viva engage community list](./cmd/viva/engage/engage-community-list.mdx)
`viva engage group user add` | [viva engage community user add](./cmd/viva/engage/engage-community-user-add.mdx)
`viva engage group user remove` | [viva engage community user remove](./cmd/viva/engage/engage-community-user-remove.mdx)

### Aligned command names

Some command names have been updated to reflect the latest Microsoft 365 terminology. Additionally, command improvements sometimes lead to renaming for better functionality alignment.

v10 command | v11 command
--- | ---
`spo tenant site archive` | [spo site archive](./cmd/spo/site/site-archive.mdx)
`spo tenant site list` | [spo site list](./cmd/spo/site/site-list.mdx)
`spo tenant site membership list` | [spo site membership list](./cmd/spo/site/site-membership-list.mdx)
`spo tenant site rename` | [spo site rename](./cmd/spo/site/site-rename.mdx)
`spo tenant site unarchive` | [spo site unarchive](./cmd/spo/site/site-unarchive.mdx)

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts to use the new command names listed.

### Aligned naming options

Just like with command names, we also have to rename options to reflect the changes in the product. We also try to make the options more descriptive and clearer to make it easier for you to use the CLI.
These changes aim to make it easier for you to use the CLI.

We've updated the following options:

Command | Old option | New option
