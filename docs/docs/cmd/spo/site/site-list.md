!!! important
    To use this command you have to have permissions to access the tenant admin site.

## Remarks

Using the `-f, --filter` option you can specify which sites you want to retrieve. For example, to get sites with _project_ in their URL, use `Url -like 'project'` as the filter.

When using the text output type, the command lists only the values of the `Title`, and `Url` properties of the site. When setting the output type to JSON, all available properties are included in the command output.
