# spo file move

Moves a file to another location

## Usage

```sh
m365 spo file move [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-u, --webUrl <webUrl>`
: The URL of the site where the file is located.

`-s, --sourceUrl [sourceUrl]`
: The server-, site-relative or absolute decoded URL of the file to move. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-i, --sourceId [sourceId]`
: The ID of the file to move. Specify either `sourceUrl` or `sourceId` but not both.

`-t, --targetUrl <targetUrl>`
: Server-relative or absolute decoded URL where to move the file.

`--newName [newName]`
: The new name of the destination file.

`--nameConflictBehavior [nameConflictBehavior]`
: Behavior when a file or folder with the same name is already present at the destination. Allowed values: `fail`, `replace`, `rename`. Defaults to `fail`.

`--retainEditorAndModified`
: Use this option to retain the editor and modified date. When not specified, these values are reset when moving to another library.

`--bypassSharedLock`
: This indicates whether a file with a share lock can still be moved. Use this option to move a file that is locked.
```

## Remarks

All file versions are retained while moving a file.

When you specify a value for `nameConflictBehavior`, consider the following:

- `fail` will throw an error when the destination file already exists.
- `replace` will replace the destination file if it already exists.
- `rename` will add a suffix (e.g. Document1.pdf) when the destination file already exists.

## Examples

Move a file to a document library in another site collection by server relative URL

```sh
m365 spo file move --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --sourceUrl "/sites/project-x/Shared Documents/sp1.pdf" --targetUrl "/sites/project-y/Archived documents"
```

Move a file specified by a server-relative URL to a document library and rename it

```sh
m365 spo file move --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --sourceUrl "/Shared Documents/sp1.pdf" --targetUrl "/sites/project-x/My Documents" --newName Report.pdf
```

Move a file to another document library and replace a file with the same name

m365 spo file move --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --sourceUrl "/Shared Documents/Report project-x.pdf" --targetUrl "/sites/project-x/My Documents" --newName Report.pdf --nameConflictBehavior replace
