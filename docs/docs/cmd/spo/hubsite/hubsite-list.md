!!! attention
    This command is based on a SharePoint API that is currently in preview and is subject to change once the API reached general availability.

When using the text output type (default), the command lists only the values of the `ID`, `SiteUrl` and `Title` properties of the hub site. When setting the output type to JSON, all available properties are included in the command output.

m365 spo hubsite list

```
