# pa app remove

Removes the specified Power App

## Usage

```sh
m365 pa app remove [options]
```

## Options

```md definition-list
`-n, --name <name>`
: The name of the Power App to remove

`-f, --force`
: Don't prompt for confirmation

`--asAdmin`
: Run the command as admin for apps you don't own.

`-e, --environmentName [environmentName]`
: The name of the environment. Required when using `asAdmin`.
```

<Global />

## Remarks

By default, the command will try to remove a Power App. As maker, you are able to delete the Power Apps you own. As administrator, you are also able to delete Power Apps from other users.

To remove an app you do not own, use the `asAdmin` option and make sure to specify the `environmentName` option as well.

To remove a model-driven Power App you need administrator permissions.

If the Power App with the name you specified doesn't exist, you will get the `Error: App 'abc' does not exist` error.
