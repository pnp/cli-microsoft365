# Setup your development environment

Setting up your local copy of the project for development and testing is essential. Follow the steps below to configure your environment.

:::info Install prerequisites

Before you start contributing to this project, you will need **node@18** and **npm@8** installed.

:::

:::tip

To avoid having to install all dependencies by hand you can use Github Codespaces or our dev container. More information can be found under [GitHub Codespaces & Visual Studio Remote Development Container](./github-codespaces-and-devcontainer.mdx).

## Getting your local version of the CLI

### Setting up your GitHub fork

1. Navigate to the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365) repository.
2. Fork this repository. On the GitHub repository page, click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the repository.
    - Make sure the option 'Copy the `main` branch only' is selected.
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. Navigate to a folder where you want to store your local copy of the CLI. Then execute the following command in your terminal: `git clone [repository URL of your fork]`.

:::tip

For more insights about forking a repository, refer to the [GitHub Docs - Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) guide.

:::

### Setting up your local project

After you've cloned your fork onto your device, navigate to the project directory and execute the following commands to get the project running.

:::note

If you have installed the CLI globally using the `npm i -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365` command, we recommend that you uninstall it, using `npm un -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365`, before running `npm link`.

:::

1. Run `npm i` to restore all project dependencies.
2. Run `npm run build` to build the entire project.
3. Run `npm link` to create a link/reference to your local project. This allows you to reference your locally installed CLI instead of the npm-hosted package.

That's it! If you run `m365 version` now, you will see that you are using the beta version of CLI for Microsoft 365 in your shell!

## Visual Studio Code extensions

Although you can use any IDE, we recommend using Visual Studio Code. When using VS Code, the following extensions will come in handy:

Extension | Why is it useful?
--- | ---
[Mocha Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter) | This extension helps you when writing tests. It can run individual tests and facilitate debugging. You also get a nice overview of all tests within the project.
[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) | We use ESLint to ensure code consistency within the project. By installing this extension, you will be notified of problems while writing code.
[MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) | We use MDX to write our documentation. This extension provides syntax highlighting and other useful features when writing MDX files.

## Npm scripts

During your development, you will need a set of commands to test, run, and validate your code. The CLI for Microsoft 365 comes with a set of commands that you can use for each occasion.

Command | Description
------ | ---
`npm run watch` | Builds the entire project first. After this, a watcher will trigger an incremental build every time a file is saved. This means that only the changed files are rebuilt, not the entire project. **You typically use this command while developing**.
`npm run build` | Builds the entire project.
`npm run clean` | Cleans the output directory by deleting all built files.
`npm run test` | Runs all tests and checks all ESLint rules. This is a combination of `npm run test:cov` and `npm run lint`. Our GitHub workflows execute this command to validate every new PR.
<nobr>`npm run test:cov`</nobr> | Runs all tests and creates a coverage report.

With these commands at your disposal, you're ready to contribute to the CLI for Microsoft 365 repository!
