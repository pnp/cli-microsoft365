    <p>I love the CLI for M365 & recommend all my students! While Microsoft offers their own command line management tools, they aren‚Äôt as robust and you always have caveat them with ‚Äúas long as you‚Äôre on Windows.‚Äù Today‚Äôs tools must work on any platform and when managing Microsoft 365, the CLI for Microsoft 365 is the only option that fits this standard. The community-based team has done a fantastic job continuously adding, improving, and updating commands to handle new scenarios that Microsoft releases, the quality of the CLI is top notch, and you can always trust it‚Äôs reliability‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a solid üëçüëç from this long-time Microsoft 365 developer!</p>

    <p>Using CLI for Microsoft 365 has been such a game-changer for me. It's super simple to use, and the real-world examples in the documentation make it easy to pick up and start automating tasks right away. What I love most is the team behind it  ‚ú® - always open to feedback and constantly improving things based on what the community needs. I work at the intersection of Power Platform, Microsoft 365 and Power Platform and honestly, it‚Äôs one of those tools that once you start using, you wonder how you ever managed without it üíñ!</p>
