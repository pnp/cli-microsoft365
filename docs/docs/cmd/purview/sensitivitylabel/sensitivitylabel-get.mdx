## Usage

```

## Options

```md defintion-list
`-i, --id <id>`
: The Id of the sensitivity label.

`--userId [userId]`
: User's Azure AD ID. Optionally specify this if you want to get a list of sensitivity labels that the user has access to. Specify either `userId` or `userName` but not both.

`--userName [userName]`

## Remarks

:::caution

This command is based on a Microsoft Graph API that is currently in preview and is subject to change once the API reached general availability.

:::

:::caution

When operating in app-only mode, you have the option to use either the `userName` or `userId` parameters to retrieve the sensitivity policy settings for a specific user. Without specifying either of these parameters, the command will retrieve the sensitivity policy settings for the currently authenticated user when operating in delegated mode.
