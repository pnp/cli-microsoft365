!!! attention

The `spfx project externalize` command helps you externalize your SharePoint Framework project dependencies using the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/).

This command doesn't change your project files. Instead, it gives you a report with all steps necessary to externalize your project dependencies. Externalizing project dependencies is error-prone, especially when it comes to updating your solution's code. This is why at this moment, this command produces a report that you can use yourself to perform the necessary changes and verify that everything is working as expected.
