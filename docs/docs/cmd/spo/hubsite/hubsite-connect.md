!!! attention
    This command is based on a SharePoint API that is currently in preview and is subject to change once the API reached general availability.

If the specified `hubSiteId` doesn't point to a valid hub site, you will get a `ResourceNotFoundException` error.

m365 spo hubsite connect --url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/contoso-sales --hubSiteId 255a50b2-527f-4413-8485-57f4c17a24d1
