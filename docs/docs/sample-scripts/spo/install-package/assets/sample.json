      "The purpose of this script is to install .sppkg package in the specified app catalog and approve all the permissions requested by the app. It is primarily used during development after executing the 'gulp package-solution' command. If the package name is not provided as a parameter, the script automatically detects and installs the package based on the project structure. To install a package from the site collection app catalog, use this script in conjunction with the '-appCatalogUrl' parameter. If the app catalog is not found in the given site URL, it will add a site collection app catalog."
